Cake - Common Applications Kept Enhanced
========================================

**Development on Cake was orignally sponsored by**
[IIS](http://www.iis.se) and is now sponsored by
[NLnet](http://nlnet.nl) We appreciate their support... and could always
use more help from others that care about speeding up the internet.

Cake is the rollup of 3 years of deployment experience of the htb +
fq\_codel based sqm-scripts [SQM](/cerowrt/wiki/SQM.md) for aqm/fq/qos
inbound and outbound bufferbloat management. For input into the design
and implementation, please join the [cake mailing
list](https://lists.bufferbloat.net/listinfo/cake) . For an alternative
approach to inbound traffic management, see [Bobbie](Bobbie.md).

Features and enhancements of cake over htb + fq\_codel
------------------------------------------------------

### 8 way set associativity

This makes the hash collision problem Toke pointed out in fq\_codel at
the ietf meeting previous **go away** even for REALLY large numbers of
flows. We note that this is not a panacea in that it means that the
codel portion of the algorithm gets less chance to run and proves
problematic... (cake stablizes at a much higher delay than we would like
right now) but it does mean that we get way better flow isolation in
general, which may lead to a more ideal aqm implementation.

### An integral shaper (that can be on or off or tuned dynamically)

Is much "tighter" than htb - uses about 30% less cpu on low end hardware
(don't take that as a final or even accurate figure!) , and is less
"bursty".

### TSO/GSO/GRO "peeling"

![](https://www.iis.se/docs/iis_logo-160x160.png)\
![](https://nlnet.nl/logo/banner-320x120.jpg)

Many ethernet device drivers and tcp stacks bulk up multiple packets for
one destination into a offloaded "superpacket" that is handed off to the
hardware. This dynamic range of 1000x1 is very hard on aqm and fq
algorithms which seek to have minimal drops and maximal fairness.

And yet, at higher rates (&gt;100mbit), present day hardware requires
those offloads be present in order to achieve maximum utilization.

So cake, when shaping to a lower rate than gigE, will peel apart large
superpackets back into packets again, and thus fq and aqm them better
than fq\_codel did.

Preliminary indications are that not doing GRO "peeling" is where the
first generation of fq\_codel enabled 802.11ac routers went wrong in
their QoS systems.

### Command line interface is WAY simpler than htb + fq\_codel


    tc qdisc add dev eth2 root cake bandwidth 50mbit
    Usage: ... cake [ bandwidth RATE | unlimited* | autorate_ingress ]
                    [ rtt TIME | datacentre | lan | metro | regional | internet* | oceanic | satellite | interplanetary ]
                    [ besteffort | squash | precedence | diffserv8 | diffserv4* ] # diffserv variants including none
                    [ flowblind | srchost | dsthost | hosts | flows* ] # hash algorithm on what fields
                    [ atm | noatm* ] [ overhead N | conservative | raw* ]
        (* marks defaults)

    (squash) removes DSCP from packets and applies 'besteffort' to the result
    (flowblind) gives pure single queue codel aqm behavior, useful for testing the new codel implementation
    (autorate_ingress) is very experimental

### ECN always on with overload protection

(so it cannot be easily gamed)

### ECN also done more right when in overflow mode

(drop then mark for an immediate congestion signal)

### Better codel model

(tighter recovery algorithm, more accurate invsqrt, earlier kick in on
overload)

### Packet limit management done with bytes rather than packets

Despite these new algorithms tightly controlling the queue size,
practical circumstances (available memory) and resistance to attacks
requires there be some outside limit at which point the qdisc
arbitrarily drops packets. fq\_codel, codel, pie, and others all use a
per packet limit.

Per packet limits has a dynamic range of roughly 1000x1 (64k to 64
bytes). This is really hard to cope with. A small limit might run you
short on keeping the device fed (for small packets) yet completely
overwhelm the memory on big (offloaded with GRO/TSO/GSO) packets.

A sensible byte limit, on the other hand has a dynamic range of about
4x1 in the worst case (each packet has about 256 bytes of overhead
associated with it, so a 64 byte packet is 5x bigger than it should be,
but a 1500 byte packet only a few percent). Additionally, when cake is
handed a bandwidth argument, it is possible to come up with a reasonable
size based on the BDP and a few heuristics, to come up with a reasonable
outer limit. To what degree cake is coming up with reasonable outer
limits right now, is still a matter of debate and coding.

### Extensive framing compensation (for DSL/ATM/PPPoe)

The initial cake-overhead patch included only “raw” and “conservative”
shortcut keywords, alongside the numeric “overhead” parameter for
experts. I’ve now worked out an extended set of keywords which, I think,
takes care of all the normal cases.

There are eight new keywords which deal with the basic ADSL
configurations. These switch on ATM cell-framing compensation, and set
the overhead based on the raw IP packet as a baseline.

ipoa-vcmux (8)\
ipoa-llcsnap (16)\
bridged-vcmux (24)\
bridged-llcsnap (32)\
pppoa-vcmux (10)\
pppoa-llc (14)\
pppoe-vcmux (32)\
pppoe-llcsnap (40)

Note that “pppoa-llc” is not a typo - it really doesn’t involve SNAP,
and is thus a little more compact than if it did.

Two more new keywords deal with the basic VDSL2 configurations. Again,
the overheads use IP as a baseline, but this time ATM cell-framing is
turned off.

pppoe-ptm (27)\
bridged-ptm (19)

For those interested in shaping ethernet links the following keywords
are defined.

ether-phy (20) - pre-amble, inter-frame gap\
ether-all (24) - pre-amble, inter-frame gap & Frame Check Sequence

The final three keywords are not for standalone use, but act as
modifiers to some previous keyword. They can be specified more than
once, which is probably only useful for “ether-vlan”.

via-ethernet (-14)\
ether-fcs (+4)\
ether-vlan (+4)

### Diffserv support

Based on the efforts of the ietf "Dart" working group, we have a rough
set of classifications that make sense into 4 bins of priority, but
getting this right, too, is a matter of debate. Certainly 8 seems like
overkill. Pure precedence is in cake as an option also, based on the
CSX-CS7 set of priorities but it should not be used in a modern diffserv
installation.

The only way we know how to "fix" bittorrent is to classify it somewhat,
somehow, as "background".

sqm-scripts used 3 tiers of priority pretty successfully as does
free.fr. - de-prioritization seems a good idea, prioritization not so
much.

Some of the history
-------------------

We have been discussing/working on this for about two years. Work
stalled out on the first two versions in september 2014 (after we hit
some major snags also). Jonathan could not work for free anymore
either... As of April 2015, he is now committed to 2-3 months work (via
a donation), and we are back to making some serious progress.

At line (native) rate cake uses more cpu than what fq\_codel does.

At a shaped rate, it does much better than htb + fq\_codel does. There
are a lot of easy cpu speed up mods left to make, but we prefer to work
on fixing two problematic bits of codel right now... adding other
features, and fixing bugs.

Cake is largely Jonathan Morton's work, based on extensive discussions
with Dave Taht, Toke, and Eric Dumazet and fragments of the various
codel and fq\_codel stuff Dave Taht had done over the last 3 years. In
particular, the set associative hash, shaper, and diffserv code
innovations are all Jonathan's contributions.

Some Statistics
---------------

Here are tons of statistics tested live on a comcast 115Mbit/12Mbit
connection. You can see both drops and marks (as the new overload
protection kicks in).

The Pk delay is the ewma of the delay being experienced by the fat flow.
Av is average. sp is the delay experienced by "sparse" flows - typical
voip dns etc that fq\_codel already did so well that we have always
found hard to measure.\
You do not see anything real for pk,av, etc because the tc dump was
taken after the test.

The "way" stuff is related to the 8 way set associative hash. We never
had a collision on this test - it is going to take serious work to
create a test that will create one!

I note that this is 1 minute of the rrul test to get this drop/mark
rate. It is useful to get a feel for what is a "good" drop rate is by
plunking these into a spreadsheet and to factor in the actual bandwidth
and bytes transferred, AND to use varying numbers of flows. Most people
do not have intuition here.

Installing "Cake" out of tree on Linux
--------------------------------------

We are attempting to make it easier for people to test cake on
pre-existing kernels. Please note that cake is under heavy development.
The API might change. The code might change. If it breaks, you get to
keep both pieces.

Do a:

**IF you have kernel source installed to leverage, adding cake is as
easy as**


    git clone https://github.com/dtaht/sch_cake.git

    cd sch_cake
    make; sudo make install

FIXME: How do you install kernel headers on various linuxes?

NOTE: I did not take the time to get the linux version checks exactly
correct, but did manage to get it to compile on linux 3.13 and linux
3.18 without error, on x86\_64, in the current git tree.

To use it properly, you will also need to build and install the iproute
with cake support:


    git clone git://kau.toke.dk/cake/iproute2/ iproute2-cake
    cd iproute2-cake
    make
    sudo make install

    #Then:

    tc qdisc add dev whatever root cake # and whatever options

Configuring cake
----------------

We had found that a ton of edge cases involving very low (sub 2.5mbit)
bandwidths, and PPPoe and ATM framing compensation were bothersome in
fq\_codel, so cake automagically does some of that, although the atm
compensation is untested at present.

You may need to do a modprobe of sch\_cake and of act\_mirred, and of
other modules (u32?) for this to work. Also, on many devices, it used to
be VERY helpful to turn off GRO on ALL ethernet devices, and TSO and GSO
on the outbound device. We added "peeling" to fix this so you no longer
have to turn off offloads like thiese.

There are numerous other traps for the unwary, documented in
[Best practices for benchmarking Codel and FQ Codel](Best_practices_for_benchmarking_Codel_and_FQ_Codel.md)
- we are trying to make those traps less dangerous in cake, for example,
we came up with a way to "peel" apart TSO/GSO/GRO offloads to deal with
packets rather than superpackets.

### Outbound configuration under linux

While we have published some mods to make cake easy to configure under
the existing sqm-scripts (cake eliminates many, many lines of code
there) and gui, they have not quite made it out to openwrt yet.

Configuration of outbound is easy, the simplest default setting is:

    modprobe sch_cake
    modprobe act_mirred
    tc qdisc add dev eth2 root cake bandwidth XXmbit # where XX is your mbit. You can do kbit also. substitute your outbound interface for eth2.

If you are interested in what pure AQM alone accomplishes, try the
"flowblind" option. If you do not want classification, specify
"besteffort". IF you want to run at line rate for your device, relying
instead on backpressure from the ethernet driver (and hopefully
<link>BQL</link>) don't specify the bandwidth.

### Inbound configuration under linux

Inbound is mildly more difficult because you have to setup an IFB
(intermediate functional block) device, and re-route inbound traffic to
it. A simple configuration (sqm-scripts example below) would be:

    ip link add name ifb4eth2 type ifb
    tc qdisc del dev eth2 ingress
    tc qdisc add dev eth2 handle ffff: ingress
    tc qdisc del dev ifb4eth2 root
    tc qdisc add dev ifb4eth2 root cake bandwidth 110000kbit besteffort
    ifconfig ifb4eth2 up # if you don't bring the device up your connection will lock up on the next step.
    tc filter add dev eth2 parent ffff: protocol all prio 10 u32 match u32 0 0 flowid 1:1 action mirred egress redirect dev ifb4eth2

We have generally found that most diffserv inbound priorities are wrong,
so we tend to specify besteffort here, and may add a "squash" option
directly to cake to remove the diffserv markings entirely.

Some example results while a rrul test was running:

A problem I have is in reconciling the Flent plots which hit a
minimum of 2ms for sparse flows, where I typically see \~200us delay in
the qdiscs themselves. I have generally not cared at all about about
anything less than 3ms prior to now.

Have I mentioned how much I hate offloads? see the backlog relative to
the number of "packets".

Still, I do think developing this out of tree will help a lot, after we
get kernel versions straightened out more. Next up is trying to get\
it to build on openwrt, also out of tree.

Installing CAKE out of tree on OpenWrt - rough instructions
-----------------------------------------------------------

This is relatively easy and recently became a lot easier due to a couple
of package handling bugs being fixed. Also as of 13 Jul 2015 Toke pushed
CAKE aware versions of some required utilities.

First you will need to install the OpenWrt source and build environment,
fuller details including required dependencies can be found at
http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/buildroot.exigence

Briefly to clone the latest version of OpenWrt, known as 'trunk' into a
subdirectory 'openwrt' of your current directory:

    git clone git://git.openwrt.org/openwrt.git

OpenWrt divides software components into packages and combines groups of
packages into feeds. For CAKE we'll need to add an extra feed as well as
add all the packages from the standard feeds. Install the standard
packages:

    cd openwrt
    ./scripts/feeds update -a
    ./scripts/feeds install -a

We're still missing the all important kernel 'cake' algorithm packet
scheduling module, and whilst we're here we might as well have the 'pie'
algorithm. Also a 'cake' aware version of tc is needed. There are
OpenWrt suitable packages in Dave Taht's 'ceropackages' package feed.
Many packages exist in this feed so we have to be careful to only
install those required.

    cp feeds.conf.default feeds.conf
    echo "src-git cero https://github.com/dtaht/ceropackages-3.10.git" >>feeds.conf

Now we need to tell OpenWrt to get this feed and install the required
packages:

kmod-sched-cake & fq\_pie are the qdisc kernel modules, tc-adv contains
a patched version of 'tc' that understands the supported options to
those modules. Suitably up-to-date sqm-scripts packages are already in
OpenWrt's package feed.

    ./scripts/feeds update -a
    ./scripts/feeds install -p cero kmod-sched-cake kmod-sched-fq_pie tc-adv

At this point we're building OpenWrt proper so you'll have to take the
options appropriate for your target hardware. Run 'make menuconfig' and
select things as required. As an example, for the Archer C7 v2 as I have
I would select/navigate the following menu/options as a bare minimum:

    Target Profile -> TP-LINK Archer C5/C7

    Luci -> Collections -> Luci (*)
            Applications -> luci-app-sqm (*)
    Kernel Modules -> Network Support -> kmod-sched-cake & kmod-sched-fq_pie (*)
    Network -> Routing & Redirection -> tc-adv (*)

Exit menuconfig, saving your configuration, then run 'make' to build
OpenWrt. You'll find binary images to flash to your router in the
bin/'platform' subdirectory.

If you're using some form of ipv6 in ipv4 tunneling then consider adding
"option tos 'inherit'" to the 'wan6' interface definition in\
/etc/config/network. This will copy the DSCP classification from the
